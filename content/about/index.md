## What is a hackspace?

A hackspace, also known as a hackerspace or makerspace, is a collaborative workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, or digital or electronic art, can meet, socialize, and work on projects. These spaces provide a physical location for individuals to share resources, tools, and knowledge.

Hackspace environments typically have a variety of equipment, including 3D printers, laser cutters, woodworking tools, electronics components, and more. Members of a hackspace community often come from diverse backgrounds and may include hobbyists, engineers, artists, and entrepreneurs. The goal is to create a supportive and creative environment where people can bring their ideas to life and collaborate on innovative projects.

Leigh Hackspace has been created with these concepts in mind. Since 2015 we've provided a space for the Leigh (and wider) community to use to 'do cool stuff'.
