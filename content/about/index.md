# About Leigh Hackspace: Where Creativity Finds a Home

Welcome to Leigh Hackspace – the beating heart of creativity and innovation in our community (Leigh, United Kingdom).

## What is a Hackspace?
A hackspace, also known as a hackerspace or makerspace, is a collaborative workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, or digital or electronic art, can meet, socialize, and work on projects. These spaces provide a physical location for individuals to share resources, tools, and knowledge.
