Leigh Hackspace is a social enterprise created for the benefit of our members and the wider Leigh community. We depend on memeberships and grants to operate, and in return we offer members access to the hackspace's facilities and resources.

The biggest asset you will find as a member is being part of a social making and learning community. Our memberbase consists of people with skills ranging from programming computers to making guitars, from self-publishing to hand stitching, and from fine art to poetry.
