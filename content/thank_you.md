**Thank you** for joining us! You now have access to Leigh Hackspace and its facilities. You're probably wondering what to do next? Hopefully we can guide you on your next steps.

### Your subscription

First of all we'll like to say your subscription isn't a contract. You can cancel it at any time, all you need to do is cancel your Direct Debit or contact a director and we'll cancel it on our side. No further action is needed.

Our subscriptions by default are set to the first of the month, if you want to change this then please get in contact with a director and we can adjust it to your needs. 

### Get chatting to other members

The hackspace uses Slack as our chat rooms, not heard of it before? Well think of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and other chat apps on your phone. The difference is rather than being a singular chat its a private space with many chat rooms about various topics. You can use it on your laptop or mobile phone.

To join our slack click [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/leighhack/shared_invite/enQtNDYzMjEyMDMxNDExLTE1MWY5N2IwMzdhMzQ0ZWFiNDkyNzJmMGM1ZmFkODcwMGM5ODFmYmI4MjhmM2JiMWEyY2E3NTRjMTQzMzljZWU) and you'll be guided to create an account with your email address.

### Vist the hackspace and get to know people

Best way to get introduced to people is to pop in during our popular times. At the moment the following times are best (as the most members are in the hackspace during these times):

* Wednesdays - 19:00-21:00
* Saturdays - 12:00-18:00

Members are also in the space at various times, so keep an eye out in the 'General' channel in Slack.

### Sign up with Authentik (optional)

Authentik is our login system for anything IT related in the hackspace, if you want to make use of our internal infrastructure for IT projects then its suggested you sign up, **but not required**!

You can [sign up here](https://id.leighhack.org/if/flow/hackspace-new-user-enrollment/), all we ask is that you use the same email address as you used with signing up for your membership, as it'll automatically link your subscription.

### Check the Wiki for information

We have a member maintained [Wiki](https://wiki.leighhack.org) which has a lot of details about the space, policies, proceedures, documentation for various tools and items available to members.

### Get in contact
