**Thank you** for joining us! You now have access to Leigh Hackspace and its facilities. You're probably wondering what to do next? Hopefully, we can guide you on your next steps.

### Your subscription

First of all, __your subscription is not a contract__. You can cancel it at any time, all you need to do is cancel your Direct Debit or contact a director and we'll cancel it on our side.

By default, subscriptions are set to the first of the month. This means your Direct Debit will be taken on or after the first of the month (should the first of the month fall on a weekend). If you would like to change this, please get in touch with a director and we can adjust it to your needs.

### Get chatting with other members

If you want to start chatting with other hackspace members straight away, the hackspace uses Slack. This is a messaging tool similar to WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger that can be downloaded to your phone, or used on your computer. 

To join our Slack click [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/leighhack/shared_invite/enQtNDYzMjEyMDMxNDExLTE1MWY5N2IwMzdhMzQ0ZWFiNDkyNzJmMGM1ZmFkODcwMGM5ODFmYmI4MjhmM2JiMWEyY2E3NTRjMTQzMzljZWU) and you'll be guided to create an account with your email address.

### Vist the hackspace and get to know people

The best way to meet your fellow members is to visit during our popular times. The most popular times at the moment are:

* Wednesdays - 19:00 - 21:00
* Saturdays - 12:00 - 18:00

### Sign up with Authentik (optional)

Authentik is our login system for anything IT-related in the hackspace. If you want to make use of our internal infrastructure for IT projects, then it's suggested you sign up **but it is not mandatory**!

You can [sign up here](https://id.leighhack.org/if/flow/hackspace-new-user-enrollment/). We ask that you please use the same email address that you used when signing up for your membership, as it will automatically link your subscription and allow you access.

### Check the Wiki for information

We have a member-maintained [Wiki](https://wiki.leighhack.org) which has details of the policies, procedures, and essential documentation for items in the space.

### Get in contact

If you have any other questions, please get in touch either via Slack or in person at the hackspace. The [Useful Contacts](https://wiki.leighhack.org/membership/useful_contacts/) page on the Wiki details who is the best contact for each hackspace area.
