Welcome to the Pi Room, affectionately named after our Unit number of 3.14. It serves as our collaborative workspace and computer hub, equipped with a set of public use PCs exclusively for our members.

Beyond its functional role, the Pi Room doubles as a social hotspot, hosting small events like [Manchester Grey Hats](https://manchestergreyhats.co.uk) Hats. Weekends often see a gathering of members immersed in various projects, engaging in lively conversations.

During quieter periods, the Pi Room transforms into an ideal co-working space. Complete with WiFi, a reliable internet connection, coffee and tea amenities, as well as a convenient tuck shop for your snack cravings.
