Welcome to the Pi Room, affectionately named after our Unit number 3.14. 
It serves as classroom and computer hub, equipped 
with a set of public use PCs for use by members and visitors.

During quieter periods, the Pi Room transforms into an ideal 
co-working space, complete with WiFi and a reliable internet connection.

The Pi Room hosts the Wednesday Code Club, a free club for learning coding 
open to all ages.
