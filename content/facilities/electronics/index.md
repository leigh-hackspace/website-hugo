Leigh Hackspace has two temperature controlled soldering stations and a 
hot air rework station.  We keep a range of discrete components in stock 
and a range of microcontroller and single board computer platforms to 
help you design and build a range of projects.  We can teach basic soldering 
skills, electronics and simple circuit board design and manufacture.
