3D printers, vinyl cutters, and laser engraving. If this sounds interesting to you then fabrication is the place you'll want to check out. 

Leigh Hackspace currently operates three 3D printers, a Anycubic Vyper, a Ender 3 Pro, and a Makerbot Replicator 2. Between them they're able to print most things you can think of. We also hold a stock of filament that is available for use by members.

We also have a CAD system available for member use, everything needed to get you started on the 3D printers and laser engraver is ready to go on the system.
