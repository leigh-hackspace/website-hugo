3D printers, vinyl cutters, and laser engraving. If this sounds interesting to you then fabrication is the place you'll want to check out. 

Leigh Hackspace currently operates three 3D printers, an [Anycubic Vyper](https://www.anycubic.com/products/anycubic-vyper), an [Ender 3 Pro](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-pro-3d-printer), and a Makerbot Replicator 2. Between them they're able to print most things you can think of. We also hold a stock of filament that is available for use by members.

For engraving, we have a hackspace built laser engraver that can work with a variety of materials. While it isn't powerful enough to cut it can handle any engraving and etching job with ease.

Our vinyl cutter is an A3 GCC Lynx S-30 desktop cutter, a small industrial machine that can handle roll and sheet material, and can do most jobs without issue.

We also have a CAD system available for member use, everything needed to get you started on the 3D printers, laser engraver, and the vinyl cutter is ready to go on the system. No extra setup of your PC is required.

### 3D Printer Status

Our 3D printers are all connected and can be tracked remotely by members, allowing you to leave long running jobs going. Here is a live look at what our printers are currently doing:
