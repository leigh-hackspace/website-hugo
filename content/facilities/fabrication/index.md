Our fabrication facilities allow you to 3D print resin and filament 
based plastics (350mm max bed size), laser cut and engrave woods and plastics (400mm bed size), 
and CNC large and small models (800mm bed size).  We're constantly improving the hardware 
in Fabrication, please see the [wiki](https://wiki.leighhack.org) for details.

Members have access to all the facilites in Fabrication after training.  We 
keep a stock of filaments and cutting materials available to members at cost, 
and members are also welcome to bring their own materials.
