Textiles is equipped with two large working tables a range of sewing 
machines and overlockers, and additional tools such as rotary cutters, 
scissors and mats.  We have a range of fabrics available for members to 
experiment on, or bring your own projects.

Members are welcome to work on Textile projects at any time, but we have 
a Textile Tuesday that provides a focal point to learn new skills, meet 
people and share projects.
