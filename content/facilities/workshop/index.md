Our woodwork shop is the home of everything loud and dusty, along with a 
stock of tools, parts, and materials you'll need to make a quick repair, 
build a chair from scratch, or create some decorative treen for the house. 

We keep a range of hand and power tools, and basic consumables (lubricants and glues).
Power tools, such as the band saw, table saw and pillar drills are available to members after Induction.
Please note that under 18s are not allowed to operate power tools in the Workshop.

A complete list of power tools and manuals is available on the [wiki](https://wiki.leighhack.org).
