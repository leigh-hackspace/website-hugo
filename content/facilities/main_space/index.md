The main space is available for members to use for anything that isn't really covered by our other rooms. Next to the electronics bay it has a few desks and chairs, and is used for storage. 

In the past we've used the space to host activities for our open days, showing videos projected on one of the walls, and a quick meeting place for members to discuss and work on items.
