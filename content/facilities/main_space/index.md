Main Space is the central area of our Hackspace, laid out with tables and 
chairs, suitable for project work or hotdesking.  A small kitchen is set 
out for teas and coffees with a tuck shop.

Main Space is a collaborative hub on member evenings, with people popping 
in and out of the workshops across the hall, electronics adjacent and the 
Pi room nearby.
