Leigh Hackspace has a fully functioning darkroom equipped with four enlargers 
and a large enlarger sink.  We keep a full set of film and paper chemicals 
and a library of cameras you can take out to use in the local area.

Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with film photography, or 
a more experienced photographer, we have everything you need to process 
and develop film yourself.
