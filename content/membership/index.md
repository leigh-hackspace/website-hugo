Leigh Hackspace is a social enterprise created for the benefit of our members and the wider Leigh community. We depend on memberships and grants to operate, and in return we offer members access to the hackspace's facilities and resources.

Being a member is being part of a social making and learning community. Our membership consists of people of all ages and walks of life, we have IT workers, teachers, artists, retirees, and hobbyists. 

We suggest that you [visit the hackspace]({{< ref "/visit" >}}) in person before you commit to be a member. This will allow you to see the space, understand what is available, and how it can work for you. We have further information on our [wiki](https://wiki.leighhack.org/membership/joining/).

All memberships are collected on the 1st of the month, but if you wish to arrange an alternative date then please [contact us](mailto:info@leighhack.org).
