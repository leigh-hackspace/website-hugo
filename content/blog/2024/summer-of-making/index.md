Alongside the opening of [Leigh Spinners Mill](https://www.spinnersmill.co.uk), [Leigh Hackspace](http://leighhack.org) 
has launched our Summer Of Making programme of events open to members and non-members 
from July to September.

{{< image src="images/summer_of_making.jpg" title="Leigh Hackspace Summer of Making Flyer" width="400x" class="is-pulled-right" >}}

We're offering the opportunity to try a new range of skills from 3d printing to garment making.

Events are heavily discounted for [members]({{< ref "/membership/index.md" >}}), and members also 
have access to the Hackspace for their own projects at other times.

[You're welcome to visit for a chat or a tour.]({{< ref "/visit.md" >}})

If you have any questions, please [contact us](mailto:info@leighhack.org).
