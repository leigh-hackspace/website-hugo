Leigh Hackspace is a membership community organisation, as such sometimes we need to define rules and policies as part of a legal requirement or to ensure our community operates correctly. 

This section represents the collection of these policies and rules, if you have any queries regarding what is contained (or missing) from here, please contact the directors.
